# Git Merge Conflict Demo

## Objective
Demonstrate Git version control: branching, merge conflict creation, and conflict resolution.

## Steps Performed
1. Created a new repository.
2. Added a base file `demo.txt`.
3. Created two branches: `feature1` and `feature2`.
4. Made conflicting changes in each branch.
5. Merged `feature2` into `feature1` to simulate conflict.
6. Manually resolved the conflict.
7. Committed and pushed the resolution.

## Conflict Resolution
Merge conflict occurred in `demo.txt`. It was resolved by keeping changes from both branches.

## Branches
- main
- feature1 âœ… (resolved)
- feature2
